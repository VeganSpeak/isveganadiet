			<p>Veganism is actually an ethical lifestyle that seeks to exclude the use of animals for food, clothing, or any other purpose, as far as possible and practicable. This includes avoiding animal-derived products such as meat, dairy, eggs, honey, and gelatin, as well as products made from animals like leather, wool, silk, and fur.</p>

			<p>While diet is an important aspect of veganism, it is only one part of the larger ethical and environmental considerations that vegans prioritize. Veganism is a way of living that aims to minimize harm to animals and the planet, and promote a more sustainable and compassionate world.</p>
